# Troubleshooting

## Compiler not found

This error can occur for two reasons.

### You don't have a TeX distribution installed

You can follow the installation guide [here](/installation.md#prerequisites) to resolve this.

### Your compiler isn't in your path environment variable.

Another reason the compiler isn't found by Texitor is that it can't find the path to your compiler. Fixing this depends on your platform. We suggest looking up how to extend your path environment variable online. For windows you can follow [this](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14)>) guide. For MacOS and Linux, it depends heavily on what shell you are using, we recommend consulting the documentation for the shell you are using.
